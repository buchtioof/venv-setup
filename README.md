# venv-setup
simple script to avoid redundant python venv setup

the project is to continue to learn deeper bash scripting and try to make a script usable for everyone via package managers like homebrew, etc...

to run the script, use this command:
'curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TON_USER/TON_REPO/main/venvsetup.sh | bash -s'
